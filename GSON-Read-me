This is how to use GSON...


to get the json string generated, you call toJson with an instance of gson and pass the id you want to use to fetch and the object to be json'd

EXAMPLE

String jsonString = gsonInstance.toJson("StringID",ObjectToEncode);

to get an object generated, you call fromJson with an instance of gson and gson and pass the json string and the id you want to get out

EXAMPLE

Object javaObject - gsonInstance.fromJson(jsonString,"StringID");

ALSO API documentation can be found @ http://google-gson.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gson/docs/javadocs/index.html
