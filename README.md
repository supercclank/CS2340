Cory (superccclank):
  + Finished User, Transaction, Account classes.
  + Added:
    -AccountActivity (the page to manage accounts-placeholder, no work done)
    -LoginActivity (log in works with 'derp' 'derp', going to look into SQL lite networking tomorrow with testbed)
  * TODO -implement actual String encryption ASAP, enable adminFeature in app, come up with temp storage or set up SQL
  * Talked with a TA about passing custom objects via Intents, original thoughts was to implement Parcelable to allow objects to be Serialized, this however requires a lot of code to be written (~an hour or so), ideal case would be approval of the use of a static class and global variables (easiest impementaion), I am also looking into the possibility of either manually creating JSON objects or using GSON to create json objects (this should scale the best based on how I eventually plan on setting up the server, BUT might be a lot of work to implement it this early) TLDR; asked TA if use of static classes is okay.
